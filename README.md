Introduction
---------------

This repository contains a comprehensive dataset on vehicle sales and market trends, along with a predictive model to forecast car prices. The dataset is designed to help companies provide accurate and reliable car pricing information to customers. The predictive model uses machine learning techniques to build a robust and reliable forecasting tool.

Dataset Overview
-------------------

The dataset includes information on various vehicle characteristics, market trends, and car pricing. The dataset is divided into training and test sets, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing the model.

Key Features
--------------

 Car Pricing Information: Prices of various car models
 Market Trends: Patterns and tendencies in the car market
 Vehicle Characteristics: Make, model, year, mileage, condition, and features
 Predictive Model: A machine learning model used to forecast future values
 Feature Engineering: The process of creating features that make machine learning algorithms work better
 Regression: A type of predictive modeling technique used to estimate relationships among variables
 Target Variable: The variable that the model is trying to predict (car price)
 Training Data: The subset of the dataset used to train the model
 Test Data: The subset of the dataset used to test the model's accuracy
 Model Accuracy: A measure of how close the model's predictions are to the actual values
 Negative Root Mean Squared Error (NegRMSE): A measure of errors between paired observations expressing the same phenomenon
 Cross-Validation: A technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set

Predictive Model Evaluation
-----------------------------

The predictive model achieved an rmse >= 1600 in predicting car prices. The model was evaluated using negative root mean squared error (negRMSE), which was found to be low compared to car prices(~50k$), indicating high accuracy in car price predictions. Cross-validation was used to ensure the model's robustness and avoid overfitting.

Conclusion
-------------

This dataset and predictive model can be used by companies to provide accurate and reliable car pricing information to customers. The model's accuracy and reliability make it a valuable tool for informed purchasing decisions.
